# Algorithm_for_CodingTest

It is a space for coding test preparation.

## Commit Rule

* When you commit, please upload it in your own name!
* When pushing for the first time, only git clone is executed, but not git pull.
* From the second push, git clone is not performed, only git pull is performed.

```console

$ git clone https://github.com/oereo/Algorithm_for_CodingTest.git
$ git pull 
$ cd Algorithm_for_CodingTest
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "자신의 이름"
$ git push origin master
```

* I would be grateful if you could write down the problem in the comments on the answer of the algorithm!!! And add comments to the code

## Structure 

* It will be divided into "Baekjoon", "SW Expert Academy" and "Programmers" folders.
* Put the "cpp file(or python file)" in the algorithm folder that fits in each folder!

## 방식

* Feel free to upload!
* Feel free to add anything to add
